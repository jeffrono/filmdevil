<ul>
<li>
1_ the hierarchy location list in the search page... that shit is a good
problem for you to figure out.  we thought we had it, but I think it's
giving problems.  You gotta check it out, see how it works, and make
sure the continent/country/state/region shit you enter will work with it
(no reason why it wouldn't, but just in case)
<li>
the contact link from the view page doesn't work.
<li>
the links from the view page still are activated even if no info for them exist
<li>
the fees should have dollar signs in front
<li>
if number of film entries is unknown, its better to not show it than to
say 0
<li>
for the editing pages, its nicer if the next and previous buttons have
the same position, at least horizontally.
<li>
there are strange lines in the "does this fest accept submissions" box
<li>
if user clicks "no, the festival does not accept submissions", the user
shouln't have to fill in info on eligibility and such
<li>
fest dropdown takes way too long
<li>
handle contactfest issue
<li>
display slogans on mouseover
<li>
logo pictures...

</ul>
