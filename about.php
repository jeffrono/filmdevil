		FilmDevil also lets you write a festival review.  Did you enjoy the films?  Was it well organized?  If you've gone to a festival, you can help other filmmakers make an informed decision on whether or not it is appropriate for them.  Did the festival make an effort to promote your film?  What was the audience like?  The location?  What could have been improved?  We hope filmmakers and enthusiasts will write about their experiences at the festivals they have attended.
